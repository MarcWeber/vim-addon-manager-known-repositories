This repository is an extension to http://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager

It is the "default source" of descriptions where to get which addons for vim-addon-manager.

Have a look at all supported plugins online: http://mawercer.de/~marc/vam/index.php

You should use the special function vam#install#LoadKnownRepos() to activate
this plugin whenever you need it. For speed reasons it is only loaded when needed.

Issues which may cause us to immediately remove plugins [1]:
  - security issues or other similar sever issues (didn't happen yet)

Issues which may cause us to deprecate plugins, which means they can be
installed but a warning will be shown [1]:
  - there are other plugins doing the same, but better - unless the 
    less useful plugins are a significant simpler and people indiciate that
    they are still using it.

  - a plugin is obviously broken in a way so that its causing more harm than
    value.

[1]: If in doubt create a github ticket and let's discuss the issue.


BUGS:
  There are two plugins: one called align an done called Align. This will cause
  trouble on Windows !
